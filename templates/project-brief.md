## Usage Notes

When generating a project brief:

1. **Keep it simple** - Client should understand every word
2. **No jargon** - If you must use a technical term, explain it
3. **Visual flow** - Include a simple diagram
4. **Clear scope** - Be explicit about what's in and out
5. **Actionable next steps** - Tell them what happens next

After generating, save to: `specs/current/project-brief.md`
